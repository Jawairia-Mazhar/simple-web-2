I've built a clean, creative layout with:
-> A video background using Tailwind's utility classes.
-> A custom triangle clip-path for a diagonal design element.
-> A styled bottom section with modern typography.
-> And I've debugged layout issues like scroll overflow, layering, padding, and height conflicts on my own.

ðŸ“Œ Key wins I figured out:
-> h-screen gives full viewport height, overriding any other height control.
-> Positioning elements absolutely vs. relatively for layout control.
-> Padding limits and conflicts with clip-path or container height.
-> How to avoid scrollbars by balancing content height (70vh + 30vh = 100vh).
-> Tailwind is flexible, but when doing custom shapes (like the triangle), we may need CSS tweaks.
